‚è∫ Here's a detailed breakdown of the key issues:

  1. Mentorship Matching System

  - API URL mismatches: Frontend calls to "http://127.0.0.1:5001" but server runs on port 5002
  - Missing endpoints: Dashboard calls /get-user-matches which isn't implemented in the backend
  - Inconsistent API configuration across different components

  2. File Processing Issues

  - Conditional library imports for PDF/DOCX processing with no fallback mechanism
  - Limited file type support - only PDF/DOCX accepted despite frontend allowing more
  - Inconsistent validation between frontend and backend

  3. Environment Configuration Problems

  - Missing validation for environment variables in Firebase config
  - Inconsistent fallback values for API URLs across files
  - No validation of Firebase credential paths

  4. Dashboard Interface Limitations

  - Non-functional message button: "Message Mentor" button exists but does nothing
  - Complex match handling with multiple fallbacks suggesting reliability issues
  - Static event display with no way to add events from the UI

  5. Incomplete Stories Functionality

  - Broken navigation: Contact Us button links to non-existent /contact route
  - Missing submission system: No way for users to submit stories
  - Unimplemented sharing features mentioned in UI

  6. Limited Resource Management

  - No user contribution mechanism for resources
  - Client-side filtering only which won't scale with large datasets
  - Missing pagination for resource listings

  7. API Service Reliability Issues

  - Inconsistent error handling patterns
  - Missing endpoints referenced in frontend code
  - No retry mechanisms for failed API calls

  8. Authentication Gaps

  - Inconsistent role verification in API endpoints
  - Inadequate admin access controls
  - Roles fetched but not consistently enforced

  9. Events Feature Limitations

  - No RSVP functionality for events
  - Simple external redirects with no tracking
  - Missing notification system for upcoming events

  10. Backend Error Handling Problems

  - Minimal AI API error handling
  - Heavy reliance on mock data as fallbacks
  - Limited validation before database operation
